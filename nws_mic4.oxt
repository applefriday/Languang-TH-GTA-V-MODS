	0x2F981C4A = Dead sunbather on front lawn for days.
	0x3B743406 = Meltdown review: Four Star Fun.
	0x31D020BA = Crowdsourcing brings cheesy idea to reality.
	0x399AF975 = Sean Brown - Liberty Tree<br>Crowdsourcing has financed another idiotic idea on website Beseecher. Entrepeneur Scott Yuthers says he has enough money to start the businesses called Chesesus where he sculpts deities out of different cheeses and sells them to weddings and bar mitzvahs. He said that people enjoy eating statues of cheese, or at least he does.
	0xC4FE8FBE = Luke Austin - LS24<br>When the screen went dark and Meltdown began, I bathed in the rich images of Liberty City. The vibe was incredible. Then suddenly every movie clich- was unleashed upon the audience in rapid fire, as empty and soulless as the computer-generated backgrounds. A love interest started and didn't go anywhere. A voiceover appeared in weird places. Bizarre music choices were picked for the soundtrack. As the credits rolled, we were left with a warm fuzzy feeling about what happens when greed tries to win. It never wins. I loved this movie. It has flaws, but much like with my wife and her ever-sagging body, I will plod through the motions and get lost in the nuance.
	0xF73CF43A = Martina Bryans - Daily Rag<br>Neighbors are shocked at the passing of 82-year-old Ethel Winthrop who spent her days on a lawn chair sipping alcoholic drinks. A grandmother who was forbidden to visit her grandchildren, she made happiness the only way she knew how - with gin and screaming at passing cars. She was dead on her lawn for days before someone noticed she might not be sleeping off a hangover. Services will be held this weekend. Her will requested an open viewing in her bikini. Her family will adhere to her wishes as long as they don't have to attend.
