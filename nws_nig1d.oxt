	0x3F819940 = Ian Garraway - Liberty Tree<br>The recent revelation that United States Senators and Representatives are being sexually swayed to pass or stall legislation by an ingenious group of attractive lobbyists is troubling. ID K Street hired the most attractive women right out of college and trained them to use their influence on politicians to get legislation passed or stalled. "It's fun!" said lobbyist Bailey Kane. "I wriggle on a guys lap and he stops something called the Affordable Care Health Care Thingy. I feel like I've helped someone."
	0x34C187BA = Shame on Senators and Representatives.
	0x41F82227 = Golf attack rattles elite.
	0x71D77DEB = Baylee Capella - Prattle<br>Film director and producer Mark Fostenburg was the victim of a violent attack today when an armed assailant confronted him on a Rockford Hills golf course and stole one of his golf clubs. Mr. Fostenburg, who has made billions of dollars reproducing the same action movie plot over and over again just with different protagonists and enemies, has sensitive palms from a life of no real work. He had the golf club custom-made for him in Japan with seal skin grips. Fostenburg brushed off the incident, telling police it wasn't worth him wasting his time filing a report because he can "buy a million more of those golf clubs tomorrow, and they cost 20K a piece, so you do the math."
