	0x0B0BF7BF = Kate Ohajan - Public Liberty Online<br>A class action lawsuit against Redwood Cigarettes has been thrown into turmoil after the shocking news that four members of the jury have been murdered in Los Santos, and the even more shocking news that, according to an anonymous tip-off, they'd all been paid large sums of money to throw the case in Redwood's favor. So what does this mean? We're still not sure whether to be angry or delighted at this news, but we're no strangers to confusion and conflicted emotions at PLO and, if the events of the past 24 hours result in a new jury and a fair trial, for now we're leaning towards the latter.

	0xF8BD5322 = Shelia Hitano - Daily Globe<br>Bob Killington married Tracy Hernandez Friday. It would normally be an exciting affair, except that he is 80 and she is 25. It is disgusting that successful men think they can scoop up a young woman at any age. I work out. I run on the treadmill. But rich elder men just aren't interested in an attractive 28 year old. To hear the misogynistic comments from Killington who is almost in his grave yet is able to pull girls much younger - it fills me with an insecurity that makes me want to start cutting again.
