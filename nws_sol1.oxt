	0x02BFA7D0 = A great day out in Los Santos - stop by the Epsilon Center!
	0x3CFBE602 = Robin Wark - Los Santos Meteor<br>Dismissing reports of squabbles with legendary producer, Solomon Richards, Milton McIlroy told reporters yesterday that rumors of his unhappiness were "gross exaggerations". 'Meltdown', which is set in Liberty City but being filmed on set in Los Santos, has been a source of near limitless innuendo with both actor and director Anton Beaudelaire apparently miserable. McIlroy dismissed these stories yesterday - he told me via phone "look, making movies is hard. Otherwise any idiot could do it, and trust me, I'm not just any idiot. Of course, we've had squabbles - we're all passionate prima donnas used to getting our own way, but trust me, this picture, it's like a return to the golden age of vinewood - it just makes the financial crisis seem so interesting and understandable. People will love it."
	0x862A785A = Jenny Henderson - LS24<br>Bored by the beaches and too tired to hike mountains out in Mount Chiliad? Why not stop by and enjoy some refreshments and spiritual enlightenment at the Epsilon Centre? You have a better chance of meeting a celebrity there than anywhere else and watch an informative informercial about the meaning of life as well. Cris Formage and the Epsilon program offer pay as you pray plans that open you and your wallet up to a whole new experience.
