	0x4CAB857E = Anna Foster - Los Santos Meteor<br>Not content with attacking the fundamentals of our capitalist economy with their cheap labor and vibrant industrial base, it appears that China is now coming after our shadow economy. At a press conference earlier today announcing new intergovernmental strategies to combat drug trafficking, a spokesperson from Globopol revealed that criminal organizations from mainland China are attempting to infiltrate the US drug market.The international policing organization claims that senior gang members from a number of Chinese organized crime families have entered the country illegally in recent months, including the Wei Cheng Triad that operates out of Yangshan in Guangdong.
	0x7A5960D9 = Reed Brazier - Daily Rag<br>The Los Santos Transit Authority announced a 16 billion dollar project to install a network of streetcar rails throughout the city. "People love streetcars. They are in a lot of old movies, and you can jump on or off. And sometimes a woman gets on the streetcar in tears, and it starts to pull away, and then you chase after it, but it's too fast, and you never see her again. So you go to a boozy gin mill and pick up a floozy sitting next to you, secretly loathing her and yourself. We think this will be a big boost to tourism." City official Jack Ingram said. Others say that it's a massive waste of money in a town addicted to cars. Still others say they welcome the streetcars as something new to throw yourself in front of.

	0xA80CBC3B = Annie Frost - LS24<br>To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Emanuelle Pasorelli's legendary picture, Capolavoro is returning to local theaters. As confusing as it was when the movie debuted, the story winds its way through the mind of a man who betrayed his best friend and is fighting with retirement, his wife, and himself. The dialog is in several languages, adding to the art of it. Art isn't supposed to be understood by just anyone and this is a prime example of something you can feel good about yourself for getting through.

	0xCEE289E6 = Forrest Simon - Daily Globe<br>Motorists on the Del Perro Freeway were thrown into a panic when a high-speed gun battle broke out between two vehicles, one of which was carrying a yacht. What sparked the clash and the identity of the two groups of men involved is not yet known, but this leads us to our reader poll of the day: "Is a drive-by shootout over a luxury yacht a sign that Los Santos is in economic crisis, or out of economic crisis?"
	0xE2F6B20E = Rick Simpson - Weazel News<br>Despite recent controversies, including a court case over accusations of being a cult, more and more celebrities are choosing to become Espilonists. The Epsilon Progam, a Los Santos based religion that has been derided, attacked, ridiculed and accused of everything from charlatanism and fraud to slavery and prostitution continues to grow. Yesterday, at an Epsilon event in Los Santos, several celebrities revealed they were committed Epsilonists and vowed to help spread the message. Prominent actor Brude Space told reporters "I'm a patriot so I wanted an American religion, because I believe in America and that's what Epsilonism is all about." Celebrity and internet entrepreneur Tony McTony told reporters "I have an incredible sense of self worth and that's what Epsilonism encourages - it has really helped me understand why I am so important. " Heartthrob and rising star, Jimmy Boston announced "Cris Formage is a prophet. He saw something in me and since then my career has really taken off. Now I've got a couple movies lined up. If that isn't a cool religion, I don't know what is." The Epsilon Program also announced a plan to recruit one hundred trillion more members within five years which will ensure they will remain the world's fastest growing religion for quite a while.
