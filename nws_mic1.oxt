	0x6F8614DC = Joyce Stewart - Public Liberty Online<br>John Matros has been homeless for 18 years. He sleeps on the beach. He shits in his pants. He has been robbed of his belongings numerous times, often his entire shopping cart disappears while Matros tries to enjoy a leisurely heroin nod. But now he's battling more than the elements as the Freegans have taken over. Typically well-to-do hipsters, the Freegans leave their parents' rich homes and squat at local places, taking food from dumpsters that stores throw out and making fancy recipes. Matros says that they're taking food from the poor. The Freegans say they're recycling and not being wasteful. One man's trash is another man's cr-me br-l-e.
	0x94049049 = Gun fight at Cemetery.
	0xA2C47B58 = Sandy Munsen - Ludendorff Weekly<br>A grave was desecrated and several Chinese gangsters were left dead in a violent and bizarre incident in Ludendorff yesterday that has left police confused. In the worst violent crime to take place in the state since the famous depot robbery of nine years ago, a gangland shootout erupted at a cemetery, involving Chinese triads and an uncertain number of Caucasian gun men. The Chinese, who the FIB believe have links to the Wei Cheng Triad, a prominent criminal gang in China and Hong Kong, were not previously believed to have much presence in North Yankton although maybe they have come, enticed like everyone else, by our booming oil industry and glorious weather. No one is yet sure what caused the shootout but it seems as if someone dug up the grave of Michael Townley. Bizarrely Mr Townley was himself responsible for the robbery of nine years ago. The links between the two incidents are very unclear at present.
	0xB88B5956 = Police officer suspended after posting photos of murder victims on Lifeinvader as status updates.
	0xC8FEFA3D = Homeless fighting Hipsters in dumpster turf battle.
	0xEB8B0CE4 = Jeremy Sim - Daily Globe<br>Officer Daryl Bint was suspended after posting crime scene photos on his Lifeinvader as status updates, which you would know if you just read the headline, but I'm paid per word so I have to fatten out my stories from time to time. Mr Bint worked in Liberty City and became a police officer because he was lonely, insecure and had a tiny penis. Probably. I just made that up. I did a journalism degree and now I'm writing news updates for a website. I wanted to write expos-s of injustice not slice of life stories about cops. Who gives a fuck? Cops can suck my dick. In fact, they do, when I get drunk and act out. So, anyway, he's a cop, he took pictures of dead people, he put them online. And now he's going to prison, where he will be molested by angry dudes who hate cops. Oh the layers of irony, not sure where to start. I hate you, so I'm going to sexually assault you? I hate cops so I'm going to become one? I hate crime so here's a picture of it? I hate myself so I keep messing up and that's all there is to it.<br>Update - Jeremy Sim is no longer working for the Daily Globe. We apologize if any readers were offended by his story.
