Version 2 30
{
	0x04137EB0 = Tamara Dawkins - Starstalk<br>Willie Mc Tavish, the bassist for the Scottish hair metal legends Love Fist, has been attacked by an obsessed fan in Los Santos' Tequi-la- la nightclub. The assailant forced his way into the club, punched the rock star in the mouth and made off with one of his gold teeth. Willie seemed relatively unfazed by the attack and continued drinking whiskey.
	0xA530C0E8 = John Jackson - Talkin' Balls<br>You must have seen the announcement that Incarcerate US is planning to buy the Corkers. A for-profit prison company running a sports team? Many are shocked. But we think it makes sense. The majority of sports stars these days are either criminals or about to be criminals, as unscrupulous sports agents take talented but spoiled and na-ve young women and men, and encourage them to buy sports cars and act like assholes in order to get press and increase their Bleeter followers. It is a sad world we live in. Greed, guts and glory are the only things that will see us through.
	0xC3644585 = Love Fist's Willie McTavish attacked!
	0xF4B2A821 = Nothing more American than prison and baseball.
