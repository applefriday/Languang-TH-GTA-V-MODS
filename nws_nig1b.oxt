	0x6F39FEEC = Sean Brown - Liberty Tree<br>Bill Owen was skeptical at first.<br>"Electronic shoes that tell me where to walk, guide me to deals, help me avoid bad areas of town, yeah right, that's just a dream!" said Owen. But that dream will become a reality with next quarter's launch of new Ifruit shoes, the wearable computing wonder announced by the electronics company famously known for its overpriced phones and tablets. The company also announced Ifruit underwear which vibrates when you are near a bathroom or fellow Ifruit underwear user interested in quick anonymous sex.
	0x1107FBD1 = Wearable computing gets real - iFruit Shoes.
	0x5952D31E = Henry Fernandez - Prattle<br>A vagrant broke into Tyler Dixon's Rockford Hills home and stole some of his clothes while the reality TV star was relaxing by his swimming pool. Ty-Di, the ex backing dancer who became famous for marrying Cloe Parker, divorcing her on TV, getting clean on a celebrity rehab show, losing weight on a celebrity dieting show, reorganizing his closet on a celebrity hoarding show, and solving a string of other personal problems for money on television, had a predictably moronic and arrogant response to the incident, "Can you imagine being so famous that people wanna steal your underwear? It's no big deal. I only wear clothes once anyway. It's just really humbling, dude." We'll stay on this story in case something interesting happens, which we doubt.
	0xB9FDCDBE = Ty-Di home invader makes of with wardrobe.
