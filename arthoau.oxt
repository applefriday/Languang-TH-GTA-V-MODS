	ARTHO_P1_5 = ~z~No masturbating.
	ARTHO_P1_6 = ~z~Now sit back and enjoy the show.
	ARTHO_P1_7 = ~z~Antonio! Antonio!
	ARTHO_P1_8 = ~z~Wake up! Wake up!
	ARTHO_P1_9 = ~z~Why are you asleep? How can you be asleep?
	ARTHO_P1_10 = ~z~I was not asleep. I was dreaming, but I was awake.
	ARTHO_P1_11 = ~z~Your life must be remarkable!
	ARTHO_P1_12 = ~z~These dreams you have both awake and asleep, but you're just a humble thief.
	ARTHO_P1_13 = ~z~The war made me a whore and you a thief, or was it the other way around?
	ARTHO_P1_14 = ~z~Freud has a lot to answer for!
	ARTHO_P1_15 = ~z~Who said that?
	ARTHO_P1_16 = ~z~Where are you? Show yourself!
	ARTHO_P1_17 = ~z~Antonio, what are you talking about?
	ARTHO_P1_18 = ~z~Please, Antonio. Please.
	ARTHO_P1_19 = ~z~That voice...
	ARTHO_P1_20 = ~z~You mean me?
	ARTHO_P1_21 = ~z~Yes. You-Maria-you heard her. Who was that?
	ARTHO_P1_22 = ~z~Antonio, what has gotten into you lately?
	ARTHO_P1_23 = ~z~Since Luigi's death, you're really not yourself.
	ARTHO_P1_24 = ~z~If you say so my dear. If it makes you happy, you say so.
	ARTHO_P1_25 = ~z~I married a thief. A good, honest thief, who knew his place in life.
	ARTHO_P1_26 = ~z~Now, now I am stuck with a... with a hermaphrodite.
	ARTHO_P1_27 = ~z~A creature who no longer knows if he is a man or woman.
	ARTHO_P1_28 = ~z~Which is the lie and which is the half told truth?
	ARTHO_P1_29 = ~z~Why must things always be so simple but so endlessly complicated with you Antonio?
	ARTHO_P1_30 = ~z~Yes, Maria, with you things... they are not so complicated.
	ARTHO_P1_31 = ~z~The butcher comes,
	ARTHO_P1_32 = ~z~you open your legs.
	ARTHO_P1_33 = ~z~The police comes to arrest me,
	ARTHO_P1_34 = ~z~you open your legs.
	ARTHO_P1_35 = ~z~The priest comes for confession, again.
	ARTHO_P1_36 = ~z~We know the outcome.
	ARTHO_P1_37 = ~z~You'd like to see yourself as a victim, Antonio.
	ARTHO_P1_38 = ~z~But in this life, we are only prisoners of the jails we ourselves construct.
	ARTHO_P1_39 = ~z~For a street walker and a faithless wife, you have a very ambiguous turn of phrase.
	ARTHO_P1_40 = ~z~She never loved you, Antonio.
	ARTHO_P1_41 = ~z~Who? Who never loved me?
	ARTHO_P1_42 = ~z~That I do not know. I'm just a voice that only exists in your head.
	ARTHO_P1_43 = ~z~What are you talking about Antonio? As my mother told me about you,
	ARTHO_P1_44 = ~z~The breathless extent of your dream life is a burden
	ARTHO_P1_45 = ~z~too many on the prosaic reality of our day to day physical reality.
	ARTHO_P1_46 = ~z~Maria, Maria, Maria, my precious Maria.
	ARTHO_P1_47 = ~z~Your mother, forgive me, but I will not forgive myself if I do not confess.
	ARTHO_P1_48 = ~z~She was a very ugly woman with a soul she had stolen from the Devil.
	ARTHO_P1_49 = ~z~Shame on you, Antonio
	ARTHO_P1_50 = ~z~and your wretched and primal subconscious inadequacies.
	ARTHO_P1_51 = ~z~Antonio, Antonio.
	ARTHO_P1_52 = ~z~Wake up. Wake Up.
	ARTHO_P1_53 = ~z~Shut up - you're just a voice in my head.
	ARTHO_P1_54 = ~z~Let me dream in peace.
	ARTHO_P1_55 = ~z~Is that what you wish to reduce all of these women to, Antonio?
	ARTHO_P1_56 = ~z~A reductive analysis of the feminine is a classical archetype of your repression.
	ARTHO_P1_57 = ~z~Oh for fuck's sake,
	ARTHO_P1_58 = ~z~stop sounding like my wife when she's not paying the rent on her back.
	ARTHO_P1_59 = ~z~Your wife? Is that who I am now?
	ARTHO_P1_60 = ~z~I hope not.
	ARTHO_P1_61 = ~z~Perhaps I am Luigi?
	ARTHO_P1_62 = ~z~After your treachery castrated him -
	ARTHO_P1_63 = ~z~have we considered that yet?
	ARTHO_P1_64 = ~z~We have considered it off camera many times.
	ARTHO_P1_65 = ~z~We considered modernism.
	ARTHO_P1_66 = ~z~We predicted post-modernism.
	ARTHO_P2_1 = ~z~We have embraced surrealism.
	ARTHO_P2_2 = ~z~We have refuted the technocratic vision of mankind's future.
	ARTHO_P2_3 = ~z~So much wonderment have we embraced.
	ARTHO_P2_4 = ~z~That I am left in awe of the Italian education system.
	ARTHO_P2_5 = ~z~I was taught by priests.
	ARTHO_P2_6 = ~z~And yet I know every blasphemy under the sun and revolving around the room.
	ARTHO_P2_7 = ~z~Oh Antonio, now it is you who sounds like your wife.
	ARTHO_P2_8 = ~z~Perhaps it is your innermost desire
	ARTHO_P2_9 = ~z~to be hammered night and day by the butchers and priests and policemen.
	ARTHO_P2_10 = ~z~You suggest I wish to lie with another man
	ARTHO_P2_11 = ~z~because I long to make things and hate myself for my destructive tendencies?
	ARTHO_P2_12 = ~z~I think that is a little simplistic.
	ARTHO_P2_13 = ~z~Even for the subconscious of a humble thief.
	ARTHO_P2_14 = ~z~Humility is like heaven for men such as you -
	ARTHO_P2_15 = ~z~massively over rated.
	ARTHO_P2_16 = ~z~You should embrace hell. At least you will know some people there. Like Luigi.
	ARTHO_P2_17 = ~z~Shut up about Luigi!
	ARTHO_P2_18 = ~z~He wasn't even a good man!
	ARTHO_P2_19 = ~z~Well, we can all justify the embodiment of our fall.
	ARTHO_P2_20 = ~z~Even Icarus did that,
	ARTHO_P2_21 = ~z~As he plummeted into the Azure Mediterranean.
	ARTHO_P2_22 = ~z~Classicism in thinking is the great weakness of the contemporary soul.
	ARTHO_P2_23 = ~z~So you admit you have a soul?
	ARTHO_P2_24 = ~z~I am communist, a thief and a man of the people.
	ARTHO_P2_25 = ~z~Souls are means by which the ruling class imprison us.
	ARTHO_P2_26 = ~z~What is that thing again?
	ARTHO_P2_27 = ~z~What thing?
	ARTHO_P2_28 = ~z~Liberal use of deus ex machina!
	ARTHO_P2_29 = ~z~What?
	ARTHO_P2_30 = ~z~Oh! Luigi!
	ARTHO_P2_31 = ~z~I thought you were dead.
	ARTHO_P2_32 = ~z~You killed me,
	ARTHO_P2_33 = ~z~but I forgive you in the sense that I do not exist any longer.
	ARTHO_P2_34 = ~z~So immortality is a myth?
	ARTHO_P2_35 = ~z~We are nothing but the physical embodiment of our own neuroses?
	ARTHO_P2_36 = ~z~Your wife told me that
	ARTHO_P2_37 = ~z~while she digested my sword in the marital bed.
	ARTHO_P2_38 = ~z~Is that the truth?
	ARTHO_P2_39 = ~z~The underlying anxiety of my reality?
	ARTHO_P2_40 = ~z~That what I justified by expediency
	ARTHO_P2_41 = ~z~was really the manifestation of the horns on my cuckold's head?
	ARTHO_P2_42 = ~z~How can you ask such questions of a ghost?
	ARTHO_P2_43 = ~z~The eagle that hears the whizz of an arrow as it strikes its heart
	ARTHO_P2_44 = ~z~sees that the arrow has been feathered with its own plumes.
	ARTHO_P2_45 = ~z~What a fine horse this is, Antonio!
	ARTHO_P2_46 = ~z~It's not a horse.
	ARTHO_P2_47 = ~z~It's my life.
	ARTHO_P2_48 = ~z~A man with such physical simplicity is a man I can indeed respect.
	ARTHO_P2_49 = ~z~You mean that it is my ability to negate humanity by robbing and over powering my fellow creatures
	ARTHO_P2_50 = ~z~that I create the respect of you a beautiful woman I stumbled across?
	ARTHO_P2_51 = ~z~No - she means that in your shallowness you have yet again
	ARTHO_P2_52 = ~z~sublimed the feminine into the masculine desire ideal form.
	ARTHO_P2_53 = ~z~As my mother predicted you would.
	ARTHO_P2_54 = ~z~It is a common mistake amongst traitors.
	ARTHO_P2_55 = ~z~And among sinners!
	ARTHO_P2_56 = ~z~And the repressed!
	ARTHO_P2_57 = ~z~It is only by creative expression,
	ARTHO_P2_58 = ~z~A world devoid of color, and unique camera angles,
	ARTHO_P2_59 = ~z~That our true nature can be revealed.
