	0x40A0D681 = Leslie Gardner - Weazel News<br>The FIB held a press conference yesterday to complain that the war on drugs is being lost. Not only are people taking drugs and refusing to die quickly enough but also drugs are entering the country through a bewildering number of ways. Although we can use drones to spot an insurgent on the other side of the world we are completely incapable of stopping hundreds of tonnes of contraband from entering this country because drug dealers are just clever. Not only do they dig tunnels and use submarines but now they've start using animals as unwitting couriers. An agent at the conference told reporters he had spent all day fingering a herd of cows, and although he was yet to find any drugs he would keep up his vigil until he found something or other.
	0x52F6FB2D = Forrest Simon - Daily Globe<br>A hedge fund whiz kid was found dead earlier near the Land Act Dam, in an extreme sports stunt gone horribly wrong. Dom Beasley, according to his Lifeinvader page, was a base-jumping fanatic who had become addicted to chasing ever more dangerous highs, quite possibly to over- compensate for his soulless existence in the banking industry and his lonely contribution to the human race. No parachute was found on Beasley's body, suggesting that he either jumped, was pushed, or was simply an idiot.
