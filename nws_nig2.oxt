{
	0xB1750472 = Government listening in on your phone sex.
	0xD6ECD407 = Anna Foster - Los Santos Meteor<br>Al Di Napoli has been kidnapped by a group of unknown, possibly elderly, assailants who pursued him in a high-speed chase through the streets of Los Santos, leaving a trail of carnage in their wake. Eyewitnesses report seeing the actor being put into the trunk of a car outside the Pillbox Hill Medical Center by what looked like a homeless man. It's a story unbelievable enough to be reminiscent of the kind of action movies Al used to star in before he discovered methamphetamine, and police are curious why the kidnappers picked Di Napoli, whose career has been on the skids for a over a decade, rather than somebody more famous or relevant. At this time, no ransom payment has been requested.
	0xDC3459F0 = Di Napoli kidnapping has family in tears.
	0xE6C573B8 = Rick Simpson - Weazel News<br>Despite the petty concerns of privacy advocates, the government is sensibly monitoring phone, text, and web communications to protect us from another terrorist attack. But as part of this effort, agents are also forced to monitor calls of people having phone sex. Agent Timothy Davis says he's heard about enough. "People think that monitoring private conversations would be fun and exciting, but it's mostly really boring people separated for economic reasons jacking off on the phone." The government has promised to continue the program.
