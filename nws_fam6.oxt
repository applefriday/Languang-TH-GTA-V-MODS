	0x9DE324D3 = Lazlow - body mods not a midlife crisis.
	0x66AD3DF6 = Jack Vinton - Starstalk<br>Following the ridicule he has received recently, self appointed anodyne metrosexual TV host Lazlow held a press conference yesterday to tell anyone concerned (of which there were only two of us), that his recent body modifications were 'forced on him'. In a rambling testimony, Lazlow kept talking of dark forces at work and bad men who wanted him dead, and that somehow this was not a midlife crisis. Lazlow's agent told us afterwards via cellphone "he is a great guy but he's been under a lot of stress with the show not doing so well and he's always been something of a fantasist. Best not to take him too seriously."
	0x546C9975 = John Jackson - Talkin' Balls<br>Our jimmy hats go off to baseball legend Carl Wilkins for admitting he used performance enhancing drugs before casual exploitive sex with desperate lonely groupies. It is good to see sports heroes admit what we have known for a long time: That women's reproductive organs are too complicated and in most cases you lose your erection after half an hour when you start thinking about video games and pizza. It is heartwarming to see more athletes admit they need doping before sex.
	0xFAFADF05 = It takes a hero to admit whiskey dick.
