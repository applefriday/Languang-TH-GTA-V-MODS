	0x3D748786 = Amber Sue Andrews - Senora Beacon<br>If you don't own a gun, go out and buy one. If you already own some guns, go out and buy some more. If your criminal record, age, or bill of mental health prevents you from purchasing a gun at a gun store, go to a fair or become an antique gun collector. Three criminals went into the Blaine County Savings Bank in Paleto Bay earlier today, and came out covered from head to toe in body armour with the contents of several safety deposit boxes in bags on their backs. Paleto Bay has some of the highest gun ownership per capita in the country, but there's no one wishing that number wasn't even higher today.
	0x6BC46425 = Kate Ohajan - Public Liberty Online<br>The Southern Los Santos Hospital Group and Mount Zonah Hospital were recently charged after an investigation found that the two health care providers were recruiting homeless men and women and providing medical care, often involving costly tests, and charging it back to the government and taxpayers. We say shame on prosecutors for punishing these corporate heroes who are doing something for those that our society has cast off. It doesn't matter how much health care costs - it should be free for everyone.
	0x943D1DD1 = Hospitals punished for helping homeless.
	0xBE6F7235 = Soccer madness is coming! Thanks to commercials
	0xC0F67747 = Paleto Bay Bloodbath.
	0xD1FBB096 = Patricia Lynn - Talkin' Balls<br>Soccer remains ignored and unloved in this country mainly due to long and tedious uninterrupted action, which doesn't sit well with the American palate. The LS Benders have recently announced a deal with CNT to broadcast the games. Rules will be changed to allow commercial breaks every after every 1- 2 minutes of play. This is an exciting move for a game not enjoyed by the American public who can't get enough of funny commercials.
