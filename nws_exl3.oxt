	0x1BFEBACB = Anime stereotypes hot and exciting say manga fans.
	0x50331897 = Rick Simpson - Weazel News<br>The future of Merryweather's high-value courier service, which was pitched to clients as guaranteed safe transportation of sensitive or precious cargo, lies in jeopardy today after one of their trains was derailed and robbed in Blaine County's Raton Canyon. The identity of the hijackers is still unknown. It is the latest in a series of teething problems for Merryweather's domestic operations but Don Percival assured us in a phone call that outsourcing security will still prove better for everyone in the long run.
	0xAC26507C = Shelia Hitano - Daily Globe<br>She has eyes like saucers, enormous breasts, a silly laugh and colored hair. And when I dress up as her I become another person. Princess Robot Bubblegum may be a cartoon to some, but for those of us who cosplay - it is something entirely different. Cosplay is like Halloween, except all the time and really creepy. There is a backlash and threat to ban cosplay in public spaces following a number of recent incidents. But as a journalist and cosplay enthusiast, I encourage my fellow frustrated furries to rise up, don your plastic swords and arm canons, and do not let reality get in the way of your dreams.
	0xBEE1F5F3 = John Jackson - Talkin' Balls<br>It's long been rumored to be popular with the extreme fitness and bodybuilding crowd, now one fitness guru, life style coach, entrepreneur and wiseman, Brucie Kibbutz is marketing Bullshark testosterone to a wider audience. With testosterone supplants having recently moved out of the weights room and into the bathroom of many over 45s, Mr Kibbutz is determined to help people and cash in. He told us "This extremely potent natural form of testosterone is a miracle cure for everything from lethargy and impotence to self doubt and empathy. I exercise up to 11 hours a day and I never get bored."
