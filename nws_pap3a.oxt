	0x91E408D3 = Poppy pops a few, gets behind wheel.
	0xB684108E = Faith Bailey - WNKA International<br>Brian White has been drinking Logger all his life. He has one with breakfast, drives his wife to school where she is a teacher, and then heads out to the oil field where he has worked for 34 years. But when he found out that his beloved Logger was about to be owned by the Chinese, he cried. "I don't know what to do," White blubbered.<br>Ming Ha Ling beverage of Shanghai recently purchased Logger for 4.2 billion dollars. The company promises to keep the spirit alive of the red-blooded American lager. It will be brewed in a province outside the country that most Americans are unable to name.
	0xBFB66477 = Another American icon purchased by the Chinese.
	0xE84AF41B = Angel Bell - Prattle<br>Wasted behind the wheel? Is Poppy Mitchell a young girl spiraling dangerously out of control? We certainly hope so. Police arrested her for drunk drinking earlier after a high-speed chase through the busy streets of Los Santos. For a self-proclaimed teetotal virgin, Poppy sure has done a lot of screwing and drinking this week. First an "entirely innocent" sex tape at the Gentry Manor Hotel, now an alcohol-fueled rampage through Vinewood. All-American girl, turned All-American slut, turned All-American nutjob. Don't worry, it's a well-trodden path, Poppy, and we'll hold your hand the whole way through it.
