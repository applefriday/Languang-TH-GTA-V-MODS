	0x3F98F10B = Forrest Simon - Daily Globe<br>Notorious Iconoclast Peter Dreyfuss has been found dead in an apparent vigilante hit after he was linked to the 1970s murder of a starlet. A reclusive and controversial genius, Dreyfuss enjoyed a career of spectacular highs and self inflicted lows. Now, he is dead and his reputation is in tatters after he was linked with the death of Leonora Johnson. Dreyfuss's movie career had been in hiatus for 30 years but he had apparently been preparing a comeback when rumors of a confession letter written by him to his former producer, the late David Richards, back to circulate. It seems this was enough for one vigilante who took matters into his own hands and killed Mr Dreyfuss. We would write a longer obituary but until we know which of the rumors are true and which are false, we don't want to make fools of ourselves.

	0x31555484 = John Rios - Weazel News<br>Police Spokesman Lee Whitless held up a bent, mangled bicycle tire and announced to a crowd of journalists, "This is what happens when you make the wrong transit choices."<br>The wheel is from the bicycle of Jose Arnandez, a straight A college student who had everything going for him - until he made the foolish decision to ride a bike. Police are promising to ticket anyone on a major street on a bike.
