	0x52412EED = John Jackson - Talkin' Balls<br>The revelation that baseball legend Carl Wilkins used performance enhancing drugs before meaningless sex shouldn't come as a surprise. Many would like to pretend that there are no victims here -but we all are the victims. And in the end, when we see a man like Wilkins who can throw a ball real good, and we know he's ready at any moment to pop a line drive or a turgid erection, we need that to all feel better about ourselves. An impotent sports hero is no hero at all.

	0xA1854D78 = Gavin McTavern - WNKA International<br>The American stock markets went screaming into negative and positive territory in rapid succession yesterday, with many worrying the world's largest economy is setting itself up for a doomsday scenario. The shaky American economy is causing a mass exodus of the country by many migrant workers and illegal immigrants. Raul Hernandez, a worker on a farm in San Andreas said, "I called my family, I tell them, this place is full of violent rednecks, the economy is falling apart. Stay home. Don't come to America. It is a lie."
	0xB08C6038 = Carl Wilkins doping scandal - disgrace or hero?
	0xEFE4EA32 = Shelia Hitano - Daily Globe<br>In the most audacious piece of action drama to grace the Richards Majestic movie lot in many a year, a car custom-modified for upcoming spy thriller 'Deep Inside' was stolen from under the nose of director Anton Beaudelaire during filming. Mr Beaudelaire is in the middle of a two picture deal with the studio and is dividing his time between 'Deep Inside' and 'Meltdown'. The LSPD and Richards Majestic are yet to release an official statement but reports indicate injuries, and possible casualties, but these are still unconfirmed. The loss of the car, worth millions of dollars, comes as another blow to Solomon Richards who has already been forced to drastically slash the budget on both 'Deep Inside' and his financial crisis epic 'Meltdown'.
