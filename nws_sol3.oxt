	0x2DBAAED7 = John Rios - Weazel News<br>Los Santos International airport is on lockdown after suspected terrorists fled police in a high-speed chase that ended in multiple casualties. As yet, neither the government nor the police have released a statement so we cannot say for sure that this was a foreign-led attack on American democracy, but it seems likely. We will bring you any official details as soon as we receive them and, until then, will continue to report on speculation alone.
	0x64A13E1D = Eyefind going for Money shot?
	0x545A9D90 = Masturbating Monkeys clench win.
	0xA40B9B87 = Joyce Stewart - Public Liberty Online<br>As if driving around in vans siphoning personal data from home wifi networks wasn't enough of an affront to basic human rights, search engine oligarch Eyefind has now set its sights on sending feminism back 30 years. Eyefind's 3D Street Maps will include upskirt images taken by cameras mounted throughout the city. They will be overlaid with commercials that the user must click through in order to access the lewd content. Are there any depths to which Eyefind won't sink? Is anything private? Is there anything they won't try to monetize?
	0xBDFE70DA = Terror at the airport - flights delayed - several believed dead.
	0xC9D0E711 = Henry Fernandez - Prattle<br>OMG!!!! America HEARTS those horny monkeys. Fame or Shame fans erupted with delight as the Masturbating Monkeys won the never-ending finals. A last ditch effort by Tracey DeSanta, who sang a song all girls can relate to, was no match for the wanking primates who will be going out on tour next month to delight and drench audiences nationwide.
