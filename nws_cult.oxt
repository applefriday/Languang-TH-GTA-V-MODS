	0x0CAB4821 = Bucy Joe Houston - Senora Beacon<br>A mass suicide appears to have taken place at an isolated cult camp in the hills near Mount Chiliad State Wilderness. The group, called the Altruists, seems to have been made up of baby boomers. They were mostly nude or dressed in primitive rags and involved in some grisly practices including human sacrifice and possibly cannibalism. Police are still investigating the site, but it seems they were a group of technophobes, alien hunters, gun nuts and anti-ageists convinced they could reclaim youth by drinking the blood or eating the flesh of young victims. The cult, who seem to have communicated to the world in a series of Morse code messages, were focused mostly on generational conflict and obsessed by the loss of baby boomer prestige as other demographics have tried to take some ownership over the world. Up to 50 ageing sociopaths are believed to have lived in the compound. It is not known what has happened to the rest or if this was a suicide, an execution or just part of every day life in San Andreas.
