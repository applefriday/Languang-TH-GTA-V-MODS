	FOS1_P5_16 = ~z~gay.
	FOS1_P5_17 = ~z~Gay!
	FOS1_P5_18 = ~z~I need a string quartet to come in right here.

	FOS1_P5_20 = ~z~This song's for the ladies while men go get beers.
	FOS1_P5_21 = ~z~See I don't just trash hotel rooms and shoot heroin.
	FOS1_P5_22 = ~z~The video should have two sluts fighting over me!
	FOS1_P5_23 = ~z~Sluts!
	FOS1_P5_24 = ~z~'Cause this is a power ballad -
