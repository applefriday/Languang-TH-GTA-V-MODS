	0x4EF4A441 = Sean Brown - Liberty Tree<br>Facade's Jackson Skinner, the Head of Product Development, has been murdered. Outspoken Skinner, who was always unapologetic about Facade's aggressive licensing policies and ruthless domination of the operating system market, had found himself at the center of a data mining scandal in recent weeks. On its own, this wouldn't be motive enough to suggest a conspiracy but, following in the wake of the Bilkinton and Redwood assassinations, many are starting to ask the question - is there a vendetta against corporate greed happening in Los Santos? We will continue to report on this story during any gaps in far more important East Coast news.
