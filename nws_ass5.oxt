	0x71C8021C = Faith Bailey - WNKA International<br>A vicious gun battle in the Pillbox neighbourhood of Los Santos has left a building site strewn with dead bodies. It remains unclear whether there was a motive behind the killings, or whether this was just more mindless violence for the sake of it. Gang violence and drug crime have spiked recently in Los Santos and throughout San Andreas. Commentators are unsure exactly why.
	0xA65F6B4A = Makayla Taylor - Los Santos Shepherd<br>Hypocricy and racism reared its ugly head on Bleeter last night. For those that think hate has been expunged from America, you need to look no farther than Bleeter, Lifeinvader or the comments section of any website. In a stunning fall from grace, local community activist and philanthropist Brett Parkins who was handed a tolerance award for promoting understanding and acceptance in Los Santos, has revealed himself a racist sexist hypocrite. On Bleeter he sent a wide array of horrible comments, proving that deep down inside, this town has turned us all into horrible fake people.
