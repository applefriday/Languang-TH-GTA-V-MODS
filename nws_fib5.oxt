	0x1E98C1D2 = John Rios - Weazel News<br>It's not often that we interject our opinion into politics, but the recent actions and outbursts by a candidate for governor have forced our hand. Rich divorcee Sue Murry's accusation that more qualified rival Jock Cranley should explain the deceased partygoer found in his hot tub after a recent event at his mansion, is tasteless and plays on tragedy. Cranley has repeatedly stated that his partying days are long since behind him and has been working tirelessly recruiting local dancers at strip clubs to give up the lifestyle and work in government.
	0x34E5D1B1 = Rocky Danger sent to glue factory in sky.
	0x305F655F = Reed Brazier - Daily Rag<br>Fans of his movies are outraged that Rocky Danger might not get a star on the Walk of Fame in Vinewood. The legendary horse starred in western movies like 'Annie is a Walkin Funny Now', 'Two Boots for Betty' and 'Buckin Bronco Bitches'. Some of the biggest names in pornography performed with the horse, who starred in numerous western adult films before retiring to an abattoir.
	0x2349AE79 = Candidate Murry stoops to new low.
	0xA3342E50 = Break in at biolab - perfume formula stolen.
	0xCEA7A1F1 = John Rios - Weazel News<br>A violent break in at a biotech lab in the San Chianski Mountains ended in bloodshed, mayhem and the loss of a formula for cheap perfume. The meticulously planned raid appears to have been carried out by highly skilled professionals, as thieves swam into the facility using diving equipment to access an underwater drainage pipe. Several research scientists and security personnel were killed at the facility which has been attacked by animal welfare activists in the past. The facility was once believed to have been a testing center for chemical and biological weapons, but those rumors have long been dispelled and now the facility tests soaps, high tech face creams and cosmetics. Agents are baffled as to the scale of the raid, as the perfume formula stolen was not considered particularly valuable.
