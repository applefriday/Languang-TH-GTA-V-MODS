{
	0x5EB063A7 = Prescription pain junkies flock to pharmacies
	0x546B4F1D = Miranda Cowan pap fight!
	0xE4AE0D67 = Gareth Wyn - Starstalk<br>In what must be the most media attention washed-up hag Miranda Cowan has received since turning 30 and becoming irrelevant, rival paparazzi came to blows over shots of her allegedly slamming a speedball in the back of a limousine. The two paparazzi involved, Beverly Felton and Madison Fox, are long-term contributors to Starstalk and as odious a pair of douchebags as you'll ever meet, which is why we love them. But photos of Miranda 'The Silicone Slattern" Cowan? Come on, guys. You're a decade too late with those. That drug-addled cougar has had more plastic surgery than a burn victim. Step it up.
	0xF948369B = Anna Foster - Los Santos Meteor<br>At one time Americans dealt with pain by having a stiff drink, a barbiturate, and lying down on a therapist's couch to cry. But now people are skipping the therapy and going straight to the pills. Up to one in four Americans is addicted to pain pills like Deludamol and Zombix and some warn that this spells trouble. The pharmaceutical industry has denied accusations that they are overzealously advertising morphine-based painkillers for profit. They said that the sponsorship of stock car races, football games, and little league soccer is their way of giving back to the community.
