	0x62DFFD3F = Jenny Henderson - LS24<br>OMG there were so many celebrities by the pool yesterday at the Gentry Manor Hotel it was like an orgy of ego. English Actor Scott Stephens lounged by the bar and eventually left with Delancey Medua. In a rare appearance January Natasha Vasquez showed up with the most amazing dress on, before getting drunk and making out with an unknown guy in the bathroom. (Wow! Touching a civilian!) Celebrities across town are packing the Genry Manor Motel while doing voiceover work for the the animated movie Dingleberry, a Freds production that is expected to hit theaters in the spring. Local film producers say this is the reason terrible movies cost $200 million to make.
	0x6998AAA9 = Cult crazy flees with cash.
	0x51005980 = Mike Dunn - Daily Globe<br>It has been a bizarre few weeks for The Epsilon Program. Reports indicate Epsilon's founder and leader, Cris Formage, has absconded amid accusations of a car theft ring and money laundering operation. Clearly Epsilonism is living up to its reputation as the "American religion." Mr. Formage had claimed to be close to completion of the great scriptural work of Epsilonism - The Epsilon Tract. Although now what happens to the religion, or the book without its founder, is a question we do not know the answer to.
