	0xD1483E0F = Private jet crashes in Senora Desert - dead include key witness.
	0xE5C15DE6 = Annie Frost - LS24<br>A fight broke out yesterday on Vinewood boulevard between two cosplayers outside the legendary Oriental movie theatre. The costumed men, one dressed as liberal super hero, Impotent Rage, the other as The Commander, a character in long-running space show, 'Republican Space Rangers', apparently took their characters' political affiliations too much to heart. And after calling each other names all day, and trading insults about immigration reform, payola and war mongering, suddenly The Commander took a swing at Impotent Rage and they began duking it out in front a crowd of spectators most of whom filmed events on smartphones rather than stopping or helping. The Police department has promised to crack down on make believe as a result . LSPD Spokesman Lee Whitless told us "people have to stop believing in fairies and start believing in real stuff, like weapons of mass destruction."
	0xEF1B709A = Mike Dunn - Daily Globe<br>Sean Douglas died for our sins: The sins of a public hooked on smartphones. All he wanted was the new ifruit phone being released a few months from now. But he died in that heroic quest riddled with leprosy, sleeping outside a store, getting rained on, eating out of cans, and peeing in jars. Many mocked him. But we are Sean Douglas. We are all in search of something better, something unobtainable. Something flashy and electronic that we toss in a drawer when it's no longer the hot new thing. Welcome to Armageddon America.
