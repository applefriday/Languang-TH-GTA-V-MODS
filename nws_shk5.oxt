	0x3B3B8D9C = Frank Edwards - Los Santos Meteor<br>Dr. Isiah Friedlander, radio host and author who rose to prominence recently, was killed yesterday in a murder police are calling 'suspicious.' Dr. Friedlander who recently won great fame thanks to his bestseller about his relationship with an idiotic, if terrifying and amusingly deluded sociopath and apparently retired bank robber he code names Marky De Santos. No one has yet identified the real Mr. De Santos and people are unsure even if he is alive. Only last week, Dr. Friedlander spoke to an audience about the futility of trying to work with the criminally insane and deluded. He argued that some people are truly beyond help. It seems that someone certainly wanted their money back, although whether it was for the book or the treatment remains very unclear.
	0x48F62911 = Gavin McTavern - WNKA International<br>At one time the homes of Vinewood and the surrounding hills in San Andreas were architectural delights. Every nook and cranny spoke volumes in a world of celebrated art and design. Now as a new generation of particularly uneducated and brainless celebrities and their agents take over the town of Los Santos, they are building nothing but cheaply-made megamansions. Truly this town now has little to offer the world other than a nauseating romantic comedy or movie where a man has sex with a monkey and they primates rise up and kill everyone.
