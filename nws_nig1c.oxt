	0xAE0F7095 = Baylee Capella - Prattle<br>When Derek Milanese pleaded guilty to trafficking endangered species and grinding up rhinoceros horn for his best-selling protein plus powders, he was unapologetic. "People have to get healthy, get fit, get big, get dumb, and I show them how. Milanese said in court "I had no idea that the ingredients I was buying from that Asian gentleman at the docks were from an endangered species. I thought it was ginger whey powder from China." When asked what ginger whey was, he replied "I don't know."
