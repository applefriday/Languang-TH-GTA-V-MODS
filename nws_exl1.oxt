Version 2 30
{
	0x6437B411 = "Like never ending clowns coming out of a car" Fertility doc says of woman's vagina.
	0xABA19476 = Joyce Stewart - Public Liberty Online<br>Merryweather might just have found an unlikely enemy in their domestic expansion plans: The US Army. The news that a cargo plane carrying Merryweather operatives and weapons was shot down by military jets certainly suggests that the two perhaps aren't coexisting as harmoniously as the government would like us to believe. Our doubts about private sector security are being fully realized.
	0xB2A2D0E6 = Labor dispute at Scab Rat factory.
	0xC9ECFF7A = Military industrial complex acquires complex.
	0xD9CD70CD = Leslie Gardner - Weazel News<br>Those unions are at it again! Lefty socialists workers called for strike action due to pay conditions at the factory that makes giant scab rats. Scab Rats are giant inflatable rats, usually depicted counting money and smoking cigars, that are used by unions to threaten both workers and employees and bore passersby outside places of employment that don't use unionized labour. The Scab Rat factory in Dukes, Liberty City has been accused of employing undocumented workers and breaking promises about overtime, pensions and entitlements. No one was available for comment but we would like to say something very clever about irony to end this story.
	0xF90EAF4F = Forrest Simon - Daily Globe<br>The miracle of life has awed many over the years, and while ancient cultures put women who delivered twins to death for witchcraft, these days on shows like 'Pumpin' out Puppies', the more babies the better. On the new reality show contestants are impregnated with dozens of eggs and the contestant who delivers the most babies wins. Contestant Gloria Barker is expected to deliver 21 babies on the season finale. She plans to go on public assistance.
