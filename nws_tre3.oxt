	0x2D93882A = Reed Brazier - Daily Rag<br>Murder nerds are still going crazy for Leonora Johnson, the beautiful starlet who was hacked to death nearly 40 years ago in a crime that has never been solved. The murder has long fascinated a section of Los Santos crime aficionados and recently some believe there may have been a breakthrough in the long cold case. A slip of the tongue from movie executive Ira Richards led some to believe that his grandfather, Vinewood legend David Richards may have destroyed a confession letter shortly before he died. Various people are still trying to find remnants of the letter and see who wrote it. Mr Richards now claims he was misquoted and that this is a non story but that hasn't put off amateur detectives who have long believed a Vinewood cover-up helped protect a powerful killer who may still walk among us.
	0x3FC22C87 = Robin Wark - Los Santos Meteor<br>Sergeant Tim Kenner never forgets a face. "That's because I paint pictures of every criminal I apprehend, and their faces are typically a bloody mess by the time I'm done," Kenner says. The paintings are all the rage among conservative arts patrons. Groups say that many of the people Kenner paints are never convicted of a crime and that he is effectively trolling the streets in a patrol car looking for subjects to paint. He also paints homicide scenes. "It relaxes me," Kenner said.
	0x98941254 = Stab city earning its name amidst violence.
	0xAACEB6C9 = Nerds still stiff for stiff.
	0xAE6809D1 = Claudine Shorn - Senora Beacon<br>A trailer park on the South West corner of the Alamo Sea has been destroyed in a series of explosions that could be heard as far away as Paleto Bay. 'Stab City', as it was unironically known, was a known biker gang stronghold and it is assumed that this was yet another revenge attack by rival drug gangs in the ever worsening drug wars that have been plaguing our region. When will this violence end? Can there be many more bikers left to kill at this point? Or will they just keep popping back up like weeds as we have seen so many times before?
	0xBC11D94F = Cop artist: I'm painting the perps!
